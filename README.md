Simple To-Do CRUD App 

A clean, simple, and fully functional To-Do List application built to demonstrate the core principles of CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete).

This project uses a *Node.js & Express* backend to serve a RESTful API and a *vanilla JavaScript* frontend to interact with it. It's a perfect starting point for anyone learning about full-stack web development\!

-----

 Features

  * *Create:* Add new tasks to your to-do list.
  * *Read:* View all your current tasks in a clean interface.
  * *Update:* Easily edit an existing task by clicking the edit icon.
  * *Delete:* Remove tasks you've completed.
  * *In-Memory "Database":* The backend uses a simple array to store data, meaning no database setup is required\! (Data resets on server restart).
  * *RESTful API:* A well-defined backend API that the frontend communicates with.

-----

Tech Stack

This project is built with a minimal and modern tech stack:

  Backend:
      * [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/): A JavaScript runtime environment.
      * [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/): A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework.
      * [CORS](https://expressjs.com/en/resources/middleware/cors.html): A Node.js package for providing a Connect/Express middleware that can be used to enable CORS with various options.
    Frontend:
      * *HTML5:* For the structure of the application.
      * *CSS3:* For styling and making things look nice.
      * *Vanilla JavaScript:* For all the client-side logic, using the fetch API to communicate with the backend.

 Getting Started

Ready to run the app on your local machine? Just follow these simple steps.

   Prerequisites

Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed on your computer. You can check if you have it by running this command in your terminal:

bash
node -v

 Installation & Setup

1.  *Clone the repository*
    (If you haven't pushed it to GitHub yet, you can just use the local folder you already created\!)

    bash
    git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/simple-crud-app.git
    

2.  *Navigate to the project directory*

    bash
    cd simple-crud-app
    

3.  *Install the necessary packages*
    This command reads the package.json file and installs the dependencies (Express and CORS).

    bash
    npm install
    

4.  *Start the server*
    This will fire up the backend on your local machine.

    bash
    node server.js
    

    You should see a confirmation message in your terminal:
    ‚úÖ Server is running on http://localhost:3000

5.  *Open the application in your browser*
    Navigate to [http://localhost:3000](https://www.google.com/search?q=http://localhost:3000). That's it\! You should see the To-Do app running live.

üåê API Endpoints

The backend server provides the following RESTful API endpoints:

| Method | Endpoint      | Description                  |
| :----- | :------------ | :--------------------------- |
| GET  | /items      | Fetches all to-do items.     |
| POST | /items      | Creates a new to-do item.    |
| PUT  | /items/:id  | Updates an existing item.    |
| DELETE| /items/:id  | Deletes a specific item.     |

  * Implement user authentication.
  * Add animations and smoother UI transitions.
